This is a project where I can save and keep tabs on everything I learn from the prework course, so it is a prework study guide. So far down this prework study guide I have learnt a lot and seeing the progress and accomplishment makes me proud.

This can be used as a cheat-code for quick definition look ups on different topics like HTML, CSS, JacaScript, Git. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
